          <p>When not working on projects I like to spend my time playing games, hiking, and reading various articles about new technologies, exploits, or how current tools are being built.</p>
          <p>I am a dedicated professional developer looking to consistently challenge myself and contribute to a community. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn from those willing to share their knowledge. I have recently started participating in the open source community, contributing to largely used projects such as the Atom text editor.</p><a class="site-button" href="./public/Resume-ZoeClarno.pdf">View Resume</a>

            <h4>Problem Solver</h4>
            <p>One of my favorite past times is discovering and solving puzzles. A big reason I love coding is because of how similar it is to a variety of logic puzzles. I've found that the harder a coding challenge the more excited I get, whether that be learning new languages, frameworks, other tools, or just using the knowledge I already have to solve a problem that I've never encountered. However, coding challenges aren't the only things I enjoy looking at from a new perspective; the way we approach problems and start new everyday projects can always be improved to become more graceful, understandable, and efficient.</p>

          <article class="why-me">
            <h4>Efficient</h4>
            <p>I've worked with a wide variety of development subjects. These range from: gaming, mobile apps, full stack web development, and secure development. Learning all of these different ideologies has helped me constantly refine and develop better ways to handle any situation I come up against. Looking at general standards like the Google and W3Schools JavaScript standards provide a way to easily learn and code with best coding guidelines in mind. There are many ways to solve problems, but some are more efficient and easier to maintain and read. When writing software, I strive to have clear code and elegant solutions.</p>

          <article class="why-me">
            <h4>Passionate</h4>
            <p>I was raised on logic puzzles and games, early in my career the skills that had grown as I grew, translated perfectly into the role of a developer. Since my first large programming projects when I created simple little video games, I have had an unquenchable thirst to learn and develop in new and exciting ways. A lot of my free time is spent learning about new technologies in an effort to constantly expand my knowledge and potential development opportunities.  I love what I do, and plan to continue for a long time.</p>

          <article class="why-me">
            <h4>Adaptable</h4>
            <p>I take the time to ask questions in order to inform my decisions and gain valuable feedback from others. When there are suggestions or new information I strive to be flexible. Outside of work I actively engage in projects to constantly further my skills. When given suggested improvements I can take the idea and run with it. I pay attention to those around me, how they work and the kind of work they produce, in order to inform myself on what I need to work on and how I can improve.</p>

            <p>As part of the Atom editor community, I’ve interacted and worked with Zoë for a couple months.  In every instance, she has been inquisitive, helpful and motivated. She has asked for ideas of things she could work on and when given some, she would respond swiftly, digging right in and getting to work. Having someone so eager to help with things that need doing is very refreshing.<br><br>Speaking with her, she has shown the ability to take things learned from many conversations and apply them, often with minimal instruction. She has a tendency toward experimentation with the concepts given, so I have been confident that even if I don’t explain things exactly she’ll get where I’m going with things and arrive at the proper destination.<br><br>Given her obvious intelligence, drive and interest in refining her craft, I’m confident that Zoë will do many great things and would be an asset to any organization.</p><a class="reference-author" href="https://github.com/lee-dohm" rel="nofollow">Lee Dohm</a>
