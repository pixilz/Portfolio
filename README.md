## Synopsis

This is my professional portfolio to display some of the work I have participated in over the course of my career. This repository is for my professional website hosted [here](https://zoeclarno.com).

It makes use of `gulp` to compile all assets:
- `scss` -> `css`
- `pug` -> `html`

`Pug` is used as the templating engine and it takes advantage of `JSON` files to store the majority of the page data.

Use `npm run build` to compile into a static files.
