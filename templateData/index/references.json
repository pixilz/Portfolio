She has asked for ideas of things she could work on and when given some, she would respond swiftly, digging right in and getting to work. Having someone so eager to help with things that need doing is very refreshing.<br><br>Speaking with her, she has shown the ability to take things learned from many conversations and apply them, often with minimal instruction. She has a tendency toward experimentation with the concepts given, so I have been confident that even if I don’t explain things exactly she’ll get where I’m going with things and arrive at the proper destination.<br><br>Given her obvious intelligence, drive and interest in refining her craft, I’m confident that Zoë will do many great things and would be an asset to any organization.",
