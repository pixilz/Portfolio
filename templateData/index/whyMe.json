		"description": "One of my favorite past times in the world is discovering and solving puzzles. I love coding because of this challenge. I've found that the harder a coding challenge the more excited I get, whether that be learning new languages, frameworks, or other tools; or just using the knowledge I already have to solve a problem that I've never encountered. However, coding challenges aren't the only things I enjoy looking at from a new perspective; the way we approach problems and start new everyday projects can always be improved to become more graceful, understandable, and efficient."

		"description": "I've worked with a wide variety of development subjects. These range from: gaming, mobile apps, full stack web development, and secure development. Learning all of these different ideologies has helped me constantly refine and develop better ways to handle any situation I come up against. Looking at general standards like the Google and W3Schools JavaScript standards provide a way to easily learn and code with best coding guidelines in mind. There are many ways to solve problems, but some are more efficient and easier to maintain and read. When writing software, I strive to have clear code and elegant solutions."

		"title": "Passionate",
		"description": "I was raised on logic puzzles and games, early in my development the skills that had grown as I grew, translated perfectly into the role of a developer. Since my first large programming projects when I created simple little video games, I have had an unquenchable thirst to learn and develop in new and exciting ways. I love what I do, and plan to continue for a long time."

		"title": "Adaptable",
		"description": "As a developer I love learning new things that can either make my current understanding of code better or teach me something entirely new. This leads to a lot of self improvement in everything I do. Because I have done this so often in my professional life it has carried over into my personal life to the point that I love to constantly strive and push myself to my limits to find new and exciting ways to think about and do things."
