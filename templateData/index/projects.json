        "description": "<p>The primary website for AboveTraining. During my time with AboveTraining I have been able to gain experience and knowledge for general web development. The purpose is to provide E-Learning for a variety of certifications and training in the food industry. I have been able to pitch and implement tools and features that have been beneficial to the efficiency, flow, and overall user experience on StateFoodSafety.com.</p>These include:<ul><li>Easier product management.</li><li>Updating all pages to better use templates for faster development and maintenance.</li><li>Minor integration testing relating to database and client data.</li><li>Security auditing for common web exploits. (XSS, passwords, information leak, etc…)</li><li>Small libraries to handle page elements. (modal windows, dynamic page flows, etc…)</li><li>Updating all pages to be responsive.</li></ul><p>I have expanded my knowledge to include technologies and languages that aren't being used at AboveTraining to adapt to new ideas and solutions.</p>",
